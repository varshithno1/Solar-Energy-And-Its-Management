                    <h2>Heating</h2>
                    <p>Solar energy can be used to heat water or air for use in residential, commercial, or industrial settings. Solar thermal systems use collectors to absorb sunlight and convert it into heat, which can then be used to warm up water or air.</p>

                    <p>Solar energy can also be used for heating applications, including space heating and water heating. This is typically achieved through the use of solar thermal systems, which use solar collectors to absorb sunlight and convert it into heat. The heat can then be used directly or stored for later use.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Solar thermal systems can be used for both residential and commercial applications. For example, solar water heaters can be used to heat water for use in homes and buildings, while larger solar thermal systems can be used to provide space heating for commercial buildings or to heat swimming pools.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>There are two main types of solar collectors used in solar thermal systems: flat plate collectors and evacuated tube collectors. Flat plate collectors are typically used for residential and small commercial applications, while evacuated tube collectors are more suitable for larger commercial and industrial applications.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Solar thermal systems can be an effective way to reduce energy costs and carbon emissions associated with heating. However, they typically require more upfront investment than traditional heating systems, and their effectiveness may be limited in areas with low levels of sunlight or during periods of high demand.</p>
