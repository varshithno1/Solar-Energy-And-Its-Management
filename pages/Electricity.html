                    <h2>Electricity Generation</h2>
                    <p>Solar energy can be used to generate electricity through photovoltaic (PV) cells. These cells are made up of semiconducting materials that convert sunlight into electricity.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Solar energy can be used to generate electricity through the use of photovoltaic (PV) cells, which are made up of semiconducting materials such as silicon. When sunlight hits the PV cells, it excites electrons and creates a flow of electricity. The more sunlight that hits the cells, the more electricity is generated.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>PV cells are typically assembled into solar panels, which can be mounted on rooftops or on the ground in solar farms. The panels are connected to an inverter, which converts the DC (direct current) electricity generated by the cells into AC (alternating current) electricity that can be used to power homes and businesses.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Solar energy can also be used to generate electricity through concentrating solar power (CSP) systems, which use mirrors or lenses to focus sunlight onto a central receiver. The receiver heats a fluid, such as oil or water, which is used to produce steam and drive a turbine that generates electricity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Both PV and CSP systems can be used to generate electricity on a large scale, such as for utility-scale power plants, or on a smaller scale, such as for residential or commercial rooftop installations. Solar energy is a clean and renewable source of electricity that can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.</p>
