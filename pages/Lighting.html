                    <h2>Lighting</h2>
                    <p>Solar energy can be used to power outdoor lighting systems, such as streetlights or garden lights. These systems use photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity, which is stored in batteries and used to power the lights at night.</p>

                    <p>Solar energy can also be used for lighting applications, including outdoor lighting, street lighting, and indoor lighting. This is typically achieved through the use of solar-powered LED lights, which are powered by rechargeable batteries that are charged during the day using solar panels.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Solar-powered lighting systems can be a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to traditional lighting systems, especially in areas that are not connected to the electrical grid. They can also be used in remote or off-grid areas, such as rural communities or camping sites.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Solar-powered LED lights are also known for their durability and low maintenance requirements, making them ideal for outdoor and street lighting applications. In addition, they can be easily installed and moved as needed, allowing for flexible and customizable lighting solutions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The efficiency and effectiveness of solar-powered lighting systems can be improved by using high-quality solar panels, efficient LED lights, and reliable batteries. It is also important to design the system to meet the specific lighting needs of the area or application, taking into account factors such as sunlight availability, lighting requirements, and battery capacity.</p>
