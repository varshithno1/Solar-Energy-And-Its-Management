                    <h2>Space Exploration</h2>
                    <p>Solar energy is used to power spacecraft and satellites. PV cells are used to generate electricity for communication systems, navigation systems, and other onboard systems.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Powering spacecraft: Solar panels are used to generate electricity to power spacecraft, including satellites and rovers. The panels are designed to withstand the harsh conditions of space, including extreme temperatures and radiation.</p>    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Heating: Solar thermal systems are used to heat spacecraft and equipment, especially during missions that travel far from the sun. This helps ensure that critical equipment does not freeze and become damaged.</p>    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Communication: Solar-powered communication systems are used to transmit data between spacecraft and Earth. These systems are essential for sending information from distant missions, such as the Mars rovers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Lighting: Solar-powered lights are used to illuminate spacecraft and equipment, including landing sites and rovers. These lights are designed to be highly efficient and long-lasting, since replacing them is difficult or impossible during a mission.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Powering habitats: Solar panels can also be used to generate electricity for habitats and other structures that may be established on other planets or moons. This would reduce the need to transport fuel or generators from Earth.</p>
